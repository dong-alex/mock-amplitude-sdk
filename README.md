## Install

```bash
npm install --save mock-amplitude-sdk
```

or

```bash
yarn add mock-amplitude-sdk
```

## Requirements

Node 10

## Usage

First, wrap the top-most level of your application with the `AmplitudeProvider`

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ExamplePage from "./components/ExamplePage";
import { AmplitudeProvider } from "mock-amplitude-sdk";

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <AmplitudeProvider>
        <ExamplePage />
      </AmplitudeProvider>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Any nested component requiring the amplitude context in the application should be wrapper via `withAmplitudeContext`

Class Components

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { withAmplitudeContext } from "mock-amplitude-sdk";

class Example extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleLogEvent = props.context.handleLogEvent;
    this.events = props.context.events;
  }

  handleLogClick = () => {
    this.handleLogEvent("event_name", { event_user: "1111" });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={handleLogClick} />
        {this.events.map(event => {
          <div key={event.getEventID()}>{event.getEventName}</div>;
        })}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default withAmplitudeContext(Example);
```

Functional Components

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

import { withAmplitudeContext } from "mock-amplitude-sdk";

const Example = props => {
  const { events, handleLogEvent } = props.context;

  handleLogClick = () => {
    handleLogEvent("event_name", { event_user: "1111" });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleLogClick} />
      {events.map(event => {
        <div key={event.getEventID()}>{event.getEventName}</div>;
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## API

The following methods or variables can be used within the context of any component.

### handleAPIKeyCreate(api_key)

Initializes the amplitude instance to refer to the api_key. Without a backend instance supporting this mock library, it will be automatically validated to be true and will be lost on the closing of the application. A new api key can always be generated and used later on. Returns true when session starts

### handleEndSession()

Ends the current amplitude session and removes the api key that was previously in use. If there was no api key to begin with, it will not do anything.

### handleLogEvent(eventName, eventProperties)

Main function used to track events within the application. All events will require an event name, but not all event will need event properties. These properties are in the form of objects i.e. {'user_id': 111, 'email': email@gmail.com}. All events will then be stored on a queue in the amplitude instance and will be flushed out on an interval of 2 minutes, or when flushEvents() is called.

### flushEvents()

Flush all events within the amplitude instance within the time interval, printing out the events (compressed to the first and last after 2 events). This function is automatically called every 2 minutes on the start of the amplitude session which can be invoked on startup of any application. The application can also reset the timer and force flush the events before the 2 minutes has passed.

### generateAPIKey()

Generates a random API key that will be used to track usage.

### events

Events within the amplitude instance at that current time.

### apiKey

Returns the api key associated to the amplitude instance at that time

### Event (Class)

As well, each event is able to obtain its id, name, and properties (keys, values) via the `getEventID`, `getEventName`, `getEventPropertiesKeys`, `getEventPropertiesValues`,`getEventProperties`
